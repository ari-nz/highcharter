The github issues feature is reserved for bug reports and feature requests only.
You can search in stackoverflow or post your question. I usually look the `r` 
and `highcharts` tags.

For bug reports, please provide a minimal reproducible example. By "minimal", I
mean you should reduce your example as much as possible right before the problem
you want to report disappears. By doing this, you may be able to figure out what
the problem really is before reporting to me. Please do not make me read your
hundreds of lines of code (most of which are perhaps irrelevant to the bug), or
understand dozens of variables in your particular dataset (use a simple built-in
dataset in R instead, such as `iris` or `mtcars`, or simulated data). Make your
example self-contained in one single document, i.e. avoid reading external files
if possible, which you may forget to attach to your bug report.

To include a verbatim chunk of arbitrary text, indent it by four spaces (this can be done in RStudio by selecting the text and pressing the `Tab` key once or twice, depending on your settings),
especially when it contains backticks, e.g.

        A sample document.

        ```{r}
        1 + 1  # a line of code
        ```

        Another paragraph.
